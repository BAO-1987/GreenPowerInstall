          How do solar panels work?
        </summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            Solar panels work by capturing sunlight and converting it into electricity through a process called the
            photovoltaic effect. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an electric field that generates direct
            current (DC) electricity. This electricity is then converted into alternating current (AC) electricity,
            which
            can power your home or business.
